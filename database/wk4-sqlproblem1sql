--- Part 1
--- Create temp table with column of type REAL
CREATE TEMP TABLE temp_table(
    col REAL
);

-- Inserty values into table with one NULL value
INSERT INTO temp_table (col)
    VALUES(3), (5), (NULL), (2), (1);

-- Take the average of that column
SELECT AVG(col) FROM temp_table;

-- The AVG function is not even counting the NULL value as any placeholder or value, 
-- so it calculates the average of all the real numbers, excluding NULL, results 2.75

--- Part 2 
SELECT SUM(col)/COUNT(*) FROM temp_table;
-- This one calculates the average WITH the null value counted in the total, resulting in 2.2 

SELECT SUM(col)/COUNT(col) FROM temp_table;
-- This one calculates the average of all the REAL values, EXCLUDING the null value in the total that is divided
